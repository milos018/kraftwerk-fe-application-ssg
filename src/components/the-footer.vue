      When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only, what would that wish be?” almost everyone;
      from beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to religious leaders, to children, to the
      <span class="text-[#EB7722] font-bold">average person</span> on the street states, “Peace On
      Earth” or “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary, are meaningless. As long as
      humans exist there will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history of humankind there has
      never been peace on earth. Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food and even women.
      Cain killed Abel over God's respect.
