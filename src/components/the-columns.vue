        almost everyone; from beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to religious leaders, to children, to the
        <span class="text-[#EB7722] font-bold">average person</span> on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or “An end
        to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary, are meaningless. As long as humans exist there will never be peace
        on earth. Throughout the history of humankind there has never been peace on earth. Cavemen fought other cavemen
        over territory, food and even women. Cain killed Abel over God's respect.

          The French Revolution constituted for the conscience of the dominant aristocratic class a fall from innocence,
          and upturning of the natural chain of events that ‘resounded all over Europe; the old regime became, in their
          imaginary, a paradise lost.

          This explains why some romantic poets born in the higher classes were keen on seeing themselves as faded
          aristocrats, expelled from their comfortable milieu by a reverse of fortune or a design of destiny.
          <span class="font-bold">Byron and Shelley are the prime instances of this vital pose</span>. In The Giaour he
          writes on a vampiric character: “The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and fitting doom;/ The
          close observer can espy/A noble soul, and lineage high.”
